# Resume-as-input-and-parse-the-content-in-JSON-format
This project is a simple Python script that parses a resume in plain text format and converts it into a structured JSON format. The script reads the resume content, extracts key information, and outputs the data in JSON format, making it easier to work with programmatically.
